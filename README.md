# Adaptive Travel Recommendations with Reinforcement Learning

A comprehensive implementation of multi-armed bandit algorithms for personalized travel recommendations, featuring Epsilon-Greedy, LinUCB, and Thompson Sampling approaches.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements and compares three reinforcement learning algorithms for adaptive travel recommendations based on Vietnamese travel destinations:

- **Epsilon-Greedy**: Simple exploration-exploitation strategy
- **LinUCB**: Contextual bandit with upper confidence bound
- **Thompson Sampling**: Bayesian approach with posterior sampling

The system uses real Vietnamese travel destinations from `data/final_dataset.csv` and generates synthetic user click behavior to train recommendation models.
